Github public repo

Small code snippets and projects dating back as far as 2004.  This is from the oldest part of my personal source repo.  Despite what the github tag says this code is written in C/C++ Python, Java and assembly.

WebVideoDatabase:  A RESTful library API for my ancient VHS (now mp3) collection.  Uses JAX-RS Jersey / Tomcat / SQL. 
Will have an Angular front end so videos can be searched, meta data edited, and played via browser or QTPlayer.

Pluto: A collaboration for Openstack-Operators.  This tool assists in Openstack installation , which can be a long and difficult process.   It is also evolving into a configuration management tool for Openstack.  

PIC: Small LED projects for the Pic Micro series of micorprocessors.

Sysadmin: Scripts and such used for server administration around here.

ocstl:  The OpenCountry Standard Tiny Library.  Basically embedded C++ utility code to support 
basics like Buffer, String, Map, etc.
