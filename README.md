Github public repo

For the moment, this first repo contains both sample source code for potential employers as well as shared collaborations.  Duplicates of all of this exist on my own Git repo server.

Pluto: A collaboration for Openstack-Operators.  This tool assists in Openstack installation , which can be a long and difficult process.   It is also evolving into a configuration management tool for Openstack.  

PIC: Small LED projects for the Pic Micro series of micorprocessors.

Sysadmin: Scripts and such used for server administration around here.

ocstl:  The OpenCountry Standard Tiny Library.  Basically embedded C++ utility code to support 
basics like Buffer, String, Map, etc.
