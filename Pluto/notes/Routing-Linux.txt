Routing Tables for Dummies??

Simply put
IP routing involves forwarding of IP datagrams. Its a simple process in which the host 
sends the IP datagram directly to the destination if the destination host is connected. 
For example, through a point to point link or through a shared network. If the destination 
host is not directly connected then the host sends the IP datagram to the default router 
and lets the router decide where to send the IP datagram further.

#Anything on eth0, forward to router gateway
