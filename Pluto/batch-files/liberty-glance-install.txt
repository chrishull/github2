# Pluto - Openstack Configuration Manager
# Batch file for Openstack Liberty Glance installation
#
# This batch file contains instructions for installing Liberty Glance as seen here.
# http://docs.openstack.org/liberty/install-guide-rdo/glance-install.html
# You can more or less cut and paste config file instructions from the above page.
# See below.

# Processor Directives
#
# There are a small number of processor directives in this file.  
# They all begin with a "&"

# Processor Directive  &INSTALL_NOTE
# This processor will automatically add comments to .conf files.
# This allows you to track changes and do some debugging if necessary.
# This note simply marks the initial installation.
&INSTALL_NOTE Liberty Glance service initial install

# Processor Directive  &CONF_FILE_NAME
# All subsequent modifications will take place for the conf file specified here.
# No need for full path.  File searches are constrained by a root spec plus list
# of known Openstack dirs ( /etc plus /nova, /glance, /neutron...)

# Processor Directive  &ECHO
# Prints the line to the screen.  Simple.  No variable resolution.

# Variable Resolution
#
# Variables seen thruout the install guide, such as GLANCE_DBPASS are automatically resolved 
# based on dictionary settings.
# Find them in variables.py  OPENSTACK_VARIABLES and change them to your liking.
# You can cut and paste settings right out of the Openstack install instructions.
# We skip "..." and lines beginning with a '#' among others.
