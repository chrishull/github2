# Configure the common component

# The Networking common component configuration includes the 
# authentication mechanism, message queue, and plug-in.

# Note

# Default configuration files vary by distribution. You might 
# need to add these sections and options rather than modifying 
# existing sections and options. Also, an ellipsis (...) in the 
# configuration snippets indicates potential default configuration 
# options that you should retain.

# Edit the /etc/neutron/neutron.conf file and complete the following actions:
&CONF_FILE_NAME neutron.conf

# In the [database] section, comment out any connection 
# options because compute nodes do not directly access the database.

&ECHO File /etc/neutron/neutron.conf
&ECHO In the [database] section, comment out any connection 
&ECHO options because compute nodes do not directly access the database.
&ECHO DO NOT DO THIS IF THIS IS ALSO THE NEUTRON CONTROL NODE.
&ECHO BECAUSE NEUTRON CONTROL NEEDS THE DB OF COURSE.

# In the [DEFAULT] and [oslo_messaging_rabbit] sections, 
# configure RabbitMQ message queue access:

[DEFAULT]
...
rpc_backend = rabbit

[oslo_messaging_rabbit]
...
rabbit_host = controller
rabbit_userid = openstack
rabbit_password = RABBIT_PASS

# Replace RABBIT_PASS with the password you chose for the openstack 
# account in RabbitMQ.

# In the [DEFAULT] and [keystone_authtoken] sections, configure 
# Identity service access:

[DEFAULT]
...
auth_strategy = keystone

# in the Identity service.   variables.py

# Note
# Comment out or remove any other options in the [keystone_authtoken] section.

# NETWORK OPTION 2 CONFIG

#=======================================================================

# Configure the Linux bridge agent

# The Linux bridge agent builds layer-2 (bridging and switching) 
# virtual networking infrastructure for instances including VXLAN tunnels 
# for private networks and handles security groups.

# Edit the /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/linuxbridge_agent.ini file 
# and complete the following actions:
&CONF_FILE_NAME linuxbridge_agent.ini

# In the [linux_bridge] section, map the public virtual network to 
# the public physical network interface:

[linux_bridge]
physical_interface_mappings = public:PUBLIC_INTERFACE_NAME

# Replace PUBLIC_INTERFACE_NAME with the name of the underlying physical 
# public network interface.

# In the [vxlan] section, enable VXLAN overlay networks, configure the 
# IP address of the physical network interface that handles overlay 
# networks, and enable layer-2 population:

[vxlan]
enable_vxlan = True
local_ip = OVERLAY_INTERFACE_IP_ADDRESS
l2_population = True

# Replace OVERLAY_INTERFACE_IP_ADDRESS with the IP address of the underlying 
# physical network interface that handles overlay networks. 
# The example architecture uses the management interface to tunnel 
# traffic to the other nodes. Therefore, replace OVERLAY_INTERFACE_IP_ADDRESS 
# with each nodeâ€™s own management IP address.

# In the [agent] section, enable ARP spoofing protection:

[agent]
...
prevent_arp_spoofing = True

# In the [securitygroup] section, enable security groups and 
# configure the Linux bridge iptables firewall driver:

[securitygroup]
...
enable_security_group = True
firewall_driver = neutron.agent.linux.iptables_firewall.IptablesFirewallDriver

# Configure Compute to use Networking

# Edit the /etc/nova/nova.conf file and complete the following actions:

# In the [neutron] section, configure access parameters:
