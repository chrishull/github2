the uart routines are near the bottom.
this device was meant to send a control string in strange format to our
device.
It used a few bytes of data entered via a serial port to generate control
signals. it then sent the returned data back to the terminal.

if a key was pressed, the 'recieve from terminal' code would enter a mode
where it would let you type data into it's buffer. if you stopped long
enough
for the watchdog to time out, it would drop back into sending and recieving
data.

the first character was tossed out, a it was merely used to get attention.
the 16F84 interrupt input was used for the incoming data.

***** IF YOU USE THE 'SIMPLE' INTERFACE TO THE PC, THEN YOU MUST INVERT
***** ALL DATA POLARITY!  THIS UNIT USED A MAX-232 BUFFER WHICH INVERTS
***** THE DATA. The changes are simple to make however..


Of course, the PIC gnd and the PC Serial Port GND are connected, not shown.
